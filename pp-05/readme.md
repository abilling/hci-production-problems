## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1.http://www.d.umn.edu/itss/training/online/usability/checklist.html
2.https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1.Page titles big and bold and in the window box, I don't want to have to guess what my tab is.
2.Significant color contrast, If I have to squint, I can't read your website.
3.Resizable text, sometimes websites are too small or too big text wise and if I can't read your site or have to scroll it's going to want to make me use it less.
4.Content that preferably doesn't blink or flash. I don't have seizures but that gives me a headache and no one wants that.
5.Some sort of Captions because I can't have my headphones on all the time. This mainly applies if you are a multimedia website.
6.Content or sidebars that are linear, If I see a navigation menu up top i'm going to expect it to be horizontal, not all over the place. Same thing with pictures.
7.Links or searching have to clearly visible, If I can't find the search bar or the link I need how am i supposed to use the website?
8.I need the site to be secure and encrypted, my phone will literally not allow me to use it otherwise. Chances are if it looks sketchy or if it doesn't have that little lock? I'm not using it.
9.Simple forms that are meant for mobile or quick use, none of this scrolling all the way down the page to fill it out, none of this complicated wording, give me a sign up sheet with something so I know what i'm supposed to do on it.
10.For the love of god, ANNOUNCE YOUR CHANGES, this is more so for any big switch over or any new website, but let me know about it. Send me an email, better yet, YELL it on your website for everyone, black out the page and force them to hit accept, get it in my face, please.
