## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Android Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: the use of color, or the lack there of in this website in particular made it hard for me to focus on what it was I was supposed to fill out. Apple describes color and the use of color: "to be something that provides visual continuity and that it helps people visualize data." (Apple, 2019). This was especially important for a website so seemingly devoid of color. I chose to make the white field where all the input happens to be gray to help distinguish it from the boxes that made up the background. I ditched the outside box design for white space to make it clearer and darkened the outside of the input boxes to help force that visual depth and to make it something to be paid attention to. This would help bring attention to the input boxes, allow people to see the field where they were allowed input and to make choices, and create safe white space that wouldn't confuse people from where the information was most important.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/data-entry/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Data entry is the ability for people to make a choice for themselves through a series of choices given to them by a system, think a calendar or a donation tab. I took away some of the more tedious options for data entry to make a slightly more streamlined system, and decided to adjust the fact that, on a phone, a list of items would tear you away from what you were doing and then you would have to scroll up again. For the memberships I cut them down by type, and I added an entirely separate donation input box up close so they wouldn't have to scroll down all the way. For the monetary part, I cleaned that up by allowing anything $50 dollars and over, particularly for anything ending in a 5. I moved the social media area in to the frame aswell to allow for that choice, and highlighted the donation tab up above if anyone purely wanted to make a donation. Therefore, I present a reasonable amount of choices that don't slow the system down, and I present preset values that increment, and the ability to clearly, concisely make only a donation without having to endlessly scroll.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/accessibility/ and https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: This one is sort of a two-parter as they generally seem to go together in terms of layout. I wanted everything to be able to be read both horizontally and vertically as people like to do both on any device. It was important that everything fit on one clear screen so no moving back and forth to read would have to be used. To do that I had to be concise in my wording of the benefits and what was deemed important, and cut down on anything that couldn't be clear in it's wording. Accessibility also generally wants you to be clear and concise but also use clear contrast, so I got rid of the box design that made it hard for me to realize what was going on. I upped the colors to something that would be readable and tried to make sure it would look as un-transparent as possible, so if it was a real design it would feature clear darker colors with the ability to invert to something lighter, I also added darker lines to the previous white box area for input. With the limited but clear wording, it would allow those who need to, to up the font size to something readable for them, something that could work within the layouts an iphone can adjust to.
