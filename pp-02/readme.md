## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14e0u0ktOcidtrvlYjOJh5TXL1s
Your Rationale: We see big name gaming companies like Sony and Microsoft come in with the blues and greens of all different shades. It makes sense to go to a sort of darker color, not a yellow or even an orange because those usually bring on emotions or associations that don't go with videogames. When you think Sony or Xbox the first thing our minds go to is either a black or a blue with Playstation, or a bright green with Xbox. I brought back the blues because of their association with Sony as a company, people trust Sony, so using the blue that goes into almost a lilac might make consumers trust the new company as much as they did Sony.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52Q0u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: Spring usually means the changing of the seasons for a good reason, everything that was brown and awful and dead is now alive and well usually. Things that are alive and well are usually green, sometimes yellow and in case of water, blue. Theres Yellow for some flowers, and the sun, because Spring also means the start of days getting longer, and the snow melts and clouds leave meaning you can see the sun for longer everyday. blue is for the rivers that feed the garden, and the fact that all the fish and all the lakes are melting the ice off, allowing people to touch it without it hurting them.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3000X0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: Kids grow up knowing a limited number of colors, with 3 being just about drilled into their heads, red blue and yellow are the Primary Colors (It's technically green but kids don't need to think that hard.) I figured it would be a good idea to introduce them to something they don't know, in this case the alphabet, with something they do know, the Primary colors. They're warm and inviting and having that sort of anchor to have kids look at is exactly what they need to branch something new. This helps if they can later associate colors with certain letters, so every 3rd letter is red, and so on. It's all about comfort, and these colors in particular are comfortable.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53+1k0kwvs8lm-arcvZ-TmLHchy
Your Rationale: I wasn't exactly sure how to get a completely custom color palette with this system but that's what I got. When you think cybersecurity the first thing that comes to mind is tech, and then bad guys, and the military. The military is desperate for more people to do cybersecurity which is great. Tech usually makes people think of deep blues, the occasional green and maybe a red. I took those up to 11 because on a poster we want those to pop out, to make people stop and stare at it and maybe, just maybe, get interested. Generally, the more color on a poster, the better, as long as it makes sense. Cyber-security is a mix of science and tech, hence the blues and greens that come from those two fields. The red is for the people cybersecurity is meant to take down, in a military sense. Bright green and red would work because it forces attention, and the blue mellows it out, not so much that the blue itself isn't noticeable but more so that it's in the background. Throw some white on for the words and you've got a poster everyone will look at and maybe join the class.
